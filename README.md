# CS111 Assignment 2 ðŸ“–
As part of our assignment, we have developed a CLI library management app. This app was designed as part of my partner and I's assignment for our computer science first-year course. 

## Functionalities
The app is capable of:
- Reading data from a file and adding this data to an array.
- Displaying the data read with the Last name, First name Initial, Member ID, Age, Books Borrowed, and Membership Status.
- Displaying the data read in ascending order according to the number of books borrowed.
 - Sorting and displaying the data read according to the birth year of the member.
 - Sorting and displaying data according to the number of books borrowed, and
 - Generating a report file with the data from the app, with  details including Last name, First name Initial, Member ID, Age, Books Borrowed, and Membership Status.
   
## Getting Started
First fork and clone the repo. Make sure you have the G++ compiler installed. Then, choose the program you want to run and compile it:
```
g++ -o app.cpp Assign2_S11221203_S11220401.cpp 
```
Once successfully compiled, you can execute the output file using:
```
./app.cpp 
```
